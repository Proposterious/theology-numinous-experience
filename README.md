# Numinous Experience (Theology Project)

## About My Project

A website explaining Otto's main arguments and Siddhartha's journey to help the reader\
determine why one may or may not want to have a "numinous" experience.

## Outline/Instructions

### Review:  I want you to have some sense of what these words & phrases mean.

* orthodoxy
* numinous
* creature-feeling
* mysterium - A feeling of wonder towards a new experience/suddenly throw thyself towards this new intrigue\
with careful curiosity and with inexplicable awe
* mysterium tremendum - 'daemonic dread' (16)
  * Step 1. Experience "Shudder", "Fear"
  * Step 2. Acknowledge thyself as equating to "near nothingness"
  * Step 3. Submerge thyself to then experience "creature-feeling" and awe at the world around you
* mysterium fascinans

* Wholly Other

### What are the differences between all of these?

* Rational
* Irrational
* Non-Rational

### Prompts and Options from the Original Assessment

A conventional assessment might be a short test identify the author of several quotes, and write a short paragraph.\
Another option would be to write about one of the prompts below.

Pick one from the list below.  Write one page -- as a letter, if that helps.  Use one quote from Otto.

* Have you ever had what Otto would call a "numinous experience"?
Describe the experience, and then how 1-2 of Otto's ideas seem to fit the
experience -- or not.  Remember that the numinous experience is the
equivalent of a shadow cast by Something "objective and outside the self."
(pages 10, bottom, and 11, bottom) Also, did Otto miss anything?

* Why would someone want to HAVE a numinous experience?
* Why would someone want to AVOID a numinous experience?
* Why do "men shut their eyes," to such experiences?

* Which two ideas in The Idea of the Holy do you see in the
experiences of Siddhartha (e.g., rational/non-rational, the numinous, Wholly Other,
creature-feeling, mysterium tremendum, mysterium fascinans)?  Explain!

* How can experiencing beauty be a numinous experience? (See Ch. 2, first
paragraph, last sentence).

* In your family/school/community/society, explain how  the kinds of experiences described in The Idea of the Holy are
  * ...encouraged?
  * ...discouraged?
  * ...seen as spiritual in nature?
  * ...seen as a symptom of a medical condition requiring attention?
